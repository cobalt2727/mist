== NAME
mpr - The official command-line interface for the makedeb Package Repository

== SYNOPSIS
*mpr* clone _pkgbase_ [_options_] ...
*mpr* comment _pkgbase_ [_options_] ...
*mpr* info _pkgname_ [_options_] ...
*mpr* list-comments _pkgbase_ [_options_] ...
*mpr* search _query_ ... [_options_] ...

== DESCRIPTION
*mpr* is a command-line interface for interacting with the makedeb Package Repository.

The *comment* and *whoami* commands both require authentication via an API key in order to run. An API key can be obtained via the MPR web interface on the user's account page, and can be passed into this program via the *--token* argument or the *MPR_TOKEN* environment variable, the former being described in *OPTIONS*, and the latter in *ENVIRONMENT*.

*clone*::

*comment*::

*info*::
Get information about a package on the MPR.

*list-comments*::

*search*::

*whoami*::

== OPTIONS
Run each command with *--help* to see available options.
